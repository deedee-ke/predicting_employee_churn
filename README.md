# Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone Project

Welcome to my capstone project! In this project, I applied the skills and experience I gained from the Google Advanced Data Analytics courses to a real-world scenario.

## Project Overview

This project centers around Salifort Motors, a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. With a workforce of over 100,000 employees, Salifort Motors is a global leader in alternative energy vehicles. My task was to analyze employee survey data to develop strategies for increasing employee retention.

## Key Objectives

1. **Gather Information**: Understand the business problem and the data provided.
2. **Coding with Python**: Utilize Python for data analysis and modeling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conduct thorough EDA to uncover patterns and insights.
4. **Model Building**: Develop statistical and machine learning models to predict employee retention.
5. **Ethical Considerations**: Ensure ethical standards are maintained throughout the project.
6. **Presentation**: Communicate findings effectively to a general audience of stakeholders.

## Business Case

As a data specialist at Salifort Motors, I was tasked by the senior leadership team to analyze recent employee survey results. The goal was to design a model predicting whether an employee will leave the company based on factors like department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and other relevant data points.

## Deliverables

- **Model Selection**: Chose between a regression model or a machine learning model to predict employee attrition.
- **Analysis and Findings**: Detailed analysis and model results, along with actionable insights for improving employee retention.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the survey data and any other relevant datasets.
- **models/**: Saved models and results from the analysis.
- **Salifort_Motors_employee_retention.ipynb**: Main notebook containing the complete analysis.
- **README.md**: Overview of the project.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python packages needed to run the project.

## Documents

- **Executive Summary**: [docs/Executive_Summary.pdf](docs/Executive_Summary.pdf)
- **Strategy Document**: [docs/Strategy_Document.pdf](docs/Strategy_Document.pdf)

I hope this project demonstrates my data analytics skills and my ability to apply them to solve real business problems. Thank you for taking the time to review my work!
